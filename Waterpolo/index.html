	  <h3>About Waterpolo</h3>
	  <p>I have impoved my swim speed to be able to play faster.And I have gotten better at treading water to be able to pass and shoot more effectively.</p>
	  <p>My neighbour interested me in waterpolo because, he invited me to play with him. And his sister coached my team.</p>
	  <p>In 2021 I was not interested in wterpolo at all. And acually didn't know much of anything about it. Then the winter of that year my friend invited me to sign up for the youth team and so, I signed up and played for the winter. I was then interested to continue to play in the spring. Then over the summer before My freshman year I joined the highschool team and met the coach and the players. Eventually I made lots of friends with the players because they were fun people to be around. Now this year I am currently playing for the highschool teams spring season.</p>
	  <p>My youth coach signed up the team for a tornament in cedar city spring of 2021 to help prepare the team for the state tournement by having us play multiple games in the same day.</p>
