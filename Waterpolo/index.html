	  <h3>About My Waterpolo career</h3>
	  <p>In fall 2021 I was not interested in wterpolo at all. And acually didn't know much of anything about it My neighbour interested me in waterpolo because, he had invited me to play with him though I didn't find any intrest and declined the offer. Then the winter of that year my friend invited me to sign up for the youth team so, I signed up and played for the winter.</p>  
	  <p>I was then interested to continue to play in the spring. And My youth coach signed up the team for a tornament in cedar city in the spring of 2021 to help prepare the team for the state tournement by having us play multiple games in the same day. Then over the summer before My freshman year I joined the highschool team and met the coach and the players. Eventually I made lots of friends with the players because they were fun people to be around.We went on to win state that year.</p> 
	  <p>Now this year I am currently playing for the highschool team's spring season. Through out my waterpolo career I have impoved my swim speed to be able to play faster. And I have gotten better at treading water to be able to pass and shoot more effectively. I have also found more game sense/awareness as I have played more.</p>
